## Technical Plan

            Generate Three Random Images

    User Makes a Choice         Three New Images Generate
                                        - no duplicates
    Tracks Clicks
    Tracks Views                

                25 Selections Occur
                - Disable Images
                - Get Data
                - Display Results
                
## Data 
- Clicks and views will need to be tallied, saved and updated each round
- Will need to make sure images from the round before aren't included in the pool of assets
- Need to keep track of how many selections are made and stop at 25
