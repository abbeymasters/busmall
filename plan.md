## Technical Plan

        Generate Three Random Images

        User Makes a Choice 
        User presses Submit button        

        Track Clicks
        Track Views  
        Add turn  
        
        Take out images from round for next set
        Three New Images Generate         

        After 25 Selections Occur
        - Disable Images
        - Get Data
        - Display Results
        
                
## Data 
- Clicks and views will need to be tallied, saved and updated each round
- Will need to make sure images from the round before aren't included in the pool of assets
- Need to keep track of how many selections are made and stop at 25
