## FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS

## User 1 — Carol 
Carol is from Minnesota and occasionally takes the bus from Minneapolis to Chicago to visit her daughter and son-in-law. Carol is in her early sixties, a retired teacher, and enjoys perusing shopping channels and gardening. She usually brings a book and a pillow so she can read and then snooze the rest of the eight hour journey, but the first thing she does on her bus ritual is check out the busmall products. She knows her basics of using technology, and mostly navigates Facebook and her email app. 

Carol wants an easy navigable, clean layout for the app so that she doesn't get lost in the navigation. 

## User 2 — Pat
Pat is in his fifties, and once a week rides the bus from Houston to Austin, Texas for his job. Pat finds joy in buying unusual gifts for his wife, children, and grandchildren. Busmall is one of his favorites to flip-through for inspiration and to occasionally make a purchase. In his spare time Pat likes to cook for his family, watch football, and teach his grandkids card games.

Pat would like an array of genres to choose from so that he can find something that fits every person in his family. 

## MARKET RESEARCH TEAM PARTICIPANTS

## USER 1 — Stacey
Stacey is in her mid-30s and has been in marketing her whole career, working her way up to Project Manager at a nice marketing agency. Stacey wants the app to be modern, clean and punchy with clear navigation and UI. 

## USER 2 — John
John is a marketing manager, curious to see what products should be more heavily promoted throughout Busmall. He's more interested in the analytics than the design and would like them to be in an easily-read format.
